##### October 31, 2017 - Slime Rancher v1.1.0e
- Fixed bug where certain effects, including boom slimes would sometimes cause crashes on some hardware.
- Fixed bug where Ogden was skipping his final dialogue sequence after getting his third reward. If you've already have the third reward, simply talk to him again and you'll see this dialogue.
- Made some adjustments to the rocks near the Plort Market.
- Fixed bug where Ogden's Greenhouse door was bigger than intended.
- Fixed bug where it was possible to get stuck in a particular hole in a cavern in The Wilds.
- Fixed bug where crates dropped against a certain ground area in the Reef were made of flubber. (They continually bounced.)
